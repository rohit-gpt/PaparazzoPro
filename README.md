# PaparazzoPro

The website is hosted on the given URL:

Studio/Independent photographers first need to create their account. Then they need to enter details of the event and later, they can upload all photographs of the event. This process can be made efficient by using AWS or similar platform, which I have not incorporated in this project. After pictures are uploaded, a unique album key is generated. Guests of the party can access the album by merely entering the album key on the landing page.
